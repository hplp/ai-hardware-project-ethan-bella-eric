# Step 2: Data Acquisition and Research
- The second step is data acquisition and research. For this project, you want to collect as many audio files as possible for each of the animals you choose to classify. Generally, the more audio files you collect, the more accurate your model will be. 
- The audio files work best uploaded as .wav files, as WAV files are uncompressed and lossless. They retain all the original data and provide the highest possible quality sound output, which is ideal for accurate audio classification.
