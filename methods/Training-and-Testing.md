# Step 4: Model Training and Testing

## Model Training Parameters
To train the model effectively, we configured the following parameters in Edge Impulse Studio:
- Epochs: The model was trained for 50 epochs, a sufficient number to allow the model to converge without overfitting.
- Learning Rate: We used a learning rate of 0.0005 to allow the model to learn slowely and stablely over the 50 epochs. 
- Batch Size: Default values were used to ensure efficient computation while accommodating the dataset size.

## Testing the Model
Once training was completed, the model was tested on the reserved testing subset to evaluate its generalization ability.
- Testing Methodology:
  - Testing data consisted of 99 audio files, 18% of the dataset.
  - Edge Impulse automatically applied the trained model to unseen test samples.
    
- Validation Process:
  - Results were reviewed to identify misclassified samples and patterns in classification errors.
  - The confusion matrix was analyzed to determine how well the model distinguished between classes.
    
- Testing Workflow
  - Navigate to the Model Testing tab in Edge Impulse Studio.
  - Select the testing dataset and verify preprocessing settings.
  - Run the testing process and observe the model's predictions for each class.

## Model Performance and Results
The model's performance was evaluated using standard machine learning metrics:
- Performance Metrics
  - Training Accuracy: Achieved 86.4%, exceeding the target of 80%.
  - Training Loss: Minimal loss of 0.48, indicating strong convergence.
  - Testing Accuracy: Comparable to training results, confirming the modelâ€™s ability to generalize.

- Results Analysis
  - The model demonstrated high accuracy across most classes, with a few misclassifications in clusters where sound characteristics overlapped (e.g., dogs and frogs).
  - Model performance for each audio file:

- Confusion Matrix:
  - Visualized the distribution of true positives, false positives, and misclassifications across the four animal categories.
  - Showed high precision for cats and dogs, with minor errors in cow and frog classifications due to limited dataset size.
