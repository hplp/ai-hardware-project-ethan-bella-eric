# Hardware Integration Issues & Mitigation Strageties
The hardware connection was initially attemoted using the deployment documentation provided by Edge Impulse for the Syntiant TinyML board (https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-ai-hardware/mcu-+-ai-accelerators/syntiant-tinyml-board) using Windows 11. There were many errors which occured here when running the edge-impulse CLI installation, and the guide does not claim support for Windows 11. So, the process was then attempted using Ubuntu on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). While multiple errors still occured during the edge-impluse CLI installation, the process went smoother. Unfortunately, once the edge-impulse CLI was installed, it could still not detect the board and thus the flashing command was unsuccessful. 

Eventually, an alternative guide was provided by the instructors detailing a somewhat different method for setting up the integration environment (AlternativeGuide.md). This guide was followed (using WSL) on two devices; however, the board connection issue was still present. The Arduino CLI and edge-impulse CLI both could not detect the board, nor the firmware flash file used in the first guide. This was also attempted with the board in recovery mode. This issue was persistent, and the singular reason why we do not have on-board model testing data. One of the things noticed in this process was the presence of many differently-dated software packages needed. There were many outdated dependencies and specific version requirements (which were not explicitly provided in the guides). While there issues may not have been directly responsible for the board not being detected, they did slow the setup process extensively, causing us not to be able to determine a reliable method of connection by the end of the project. If we were to do this project again, we would test the hardware with an example model at the start, rather then waiting until the model was ready to try and deploy it on the device. Additionally, we should have done more research on the hardware options and investigated the deployment method for each option, although we may not have chosen any differently.
