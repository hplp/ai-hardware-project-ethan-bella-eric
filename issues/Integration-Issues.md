# Hardware Integration Issues & Mitigation Strageties
The hardware connection was initially attemoted using the deployment documentation provided by Edge Impulse for the Syntiant TinyML board (https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-ai-hardware/mcu-+-ai-accelerators/syntiant-tinyml-board) using Windows 11. There were many errors which occured here when running the edge-impulse CLI installation, and the guide does not claim support for Windows 11. So, the process was then attempted using Ubuntu on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). While multiple errors still occured during the edge-impluse CLI installation, the process went smoother. Unfortunately, once the edge-impulse CLI was installed, it could still not detect the board and thus the flashing command was unsuccessful. 

After deliberation on the ideal approach after this, a guide was provided by the instructors detailing an alternative method for setting up the integration environment (AlternativeGuide.md). This guide was followed (using WSL) on two devices, however the board connection issue was still present.
