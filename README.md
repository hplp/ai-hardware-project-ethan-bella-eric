### Background
*Have you ever heard an animal sound and wondered what made it?*
- BLAH WHY the project is important
- BLAH How the system can be used
  
## Objectives
- Develop a machine learning algorithm capable of processing and identifying the animal responsible for a given audio input
- Train the model such that it is capable of classifying the sounds of 4 common animals (dog, cat, frog, cow)
- Develop a trained model able of classifying with at least an 80% accuracy
- Integrate the program with the Syntiant TinyML board, utilizing the built-in microphone, so the system can be used on-site
  
## Necessary Technology
Hardware:
- Syntiant TinyML Board
- Linux, or Linux-based system enabled device
Software:
- Linux, or Linux-based system
- Package tools (git, edge-impulse-cli, arduino-cli)
- Edge Impulse Studio
